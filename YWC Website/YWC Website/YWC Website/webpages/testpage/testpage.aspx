The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word a when it precedes a word that begins with a consonant. 
It’s the word an when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel. The indefinite article indicates that a 
noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing. For example, you might ask your friend, 
“Should I bring a gift to the party?” Your friend will understand that you are not asking about a specific 
type of gift or a specific item. “I am going to bring an apple pie,” your friend tells you. Again, the 
indefinite article indicates that she is not talking about a specific apple pie. Your friend probably doesn’t 
even have any pie yet. The indefinite article only appears with singular nouns. Consider the following 
examples of indefinite articles used in context:
